# GwardiaHub Project üåê

## üìÑ About the project

We want to create website with Django, that will be useful to as many as three different user groups!

- Our classmates
- [Gwardia Czapli](https://github.com/Gwardia-Czapli/) members
- Genshin Impact players from both of above

### Modules

- For all our classmates:
  - information about lunch menu for given day,
  - calendar with events from Mobidziennik and other events, that our class want to include,
  - information about our homeworks with option to submit solution.
- For [Gwardia Czapli](https://github.com/Gwardia-Czapli/) members:
  - information about next meetings,
  - place to submit feedback about meetings,
  - assignments given on meetings.
- For Genshin Impact players:
  - TBD
  - Few ideas to enhance the game:
1)wish simulator(and list of the characters you've collected already)
2)future banners info (duration, which characters)
3)events info (duration, next events, rewards)
4)a table(or smt like that) containing incoming daily hoyolabs in/pop-up notification about next daily hoyolabs in
5)expanded ui design (later when the common one is finished, genshin inspired)
